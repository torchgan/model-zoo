# DCGAN

## Introduction

Contains minimal examples on how to use `torchgan`. DCGAN is one of the models that is supported
out of box by `torchgan`. In this case we use a custom version of DCGAN, which we prefer to call
`SmallDCGAN`. It is simply adapted to handle smaller images.

## Usage

Execute the cells one by one and follow the instructions given in the notebook.

## Results

For the results check the `models/dcgan` directory.
